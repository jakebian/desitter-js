# deSitter.js

deSitter.js allows you to picture and interact with Anti de Sitter space, with its many coordinates, in the web browser.

## Big Idea

    Given a manifold as an embedding into some higher euclidean (or Lorentzian) space, visualize:
        - The embedding
        - Coordinates
            - level curves on embedding
            - points in embedding space as points on coordinates plane.

## This project

    Do the above for AdS_3, with:
        - embedding coordinates
        - global coordinates
        - poincare patches

## Future

    - Generalize to arbitrary manifolds with covers and coordinates
    - Generalize to higher dimensions, e.g. see [hypercanvas](https://github.com/jakebian/hypercanvas.js)
